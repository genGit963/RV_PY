Hereâ€™s a comprehensive Python code example that demonstrates the use of various keywords, symbols, and common rules:

```python
# Importing the math module
import math

# Constants
PI = 3.14159  # Constant using ALL_CAPS

# Function to calculate the area of a circle
def area_of_circle(radius: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

    Parameters:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """
    return PI * (radius ** 2)

# Function to demonstrate different types of loops
def loop_examples():
    # For loop example
    for i in range(1, 6):  # Loop from 1 to 5
        print(f"Square of {i}: {i ** 2}")  # Arithmetic operator for squaring

    # While loop example
    count = 5
    while count > 0:
        print(f"Countdown: {count}")
        count -= 1  # Augmented assignment operator

# Function to demonstrate exception handling
def divide_numbers(num1: float, num2: float) -> float:
    """
    Divide two numbers, handling division by zero.

    Parameters:
        num1 (float): The numerator.
        num2 (float): The denominator.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the division.
    """
    try:
        return num1 / num2
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.", e)
        return None

# Main function to execute the program
def main():
    print("Area of Circle with radius 5:", area_of_circle(5))  # Function call

    print("\nLoop Examples:")
    loop_examples()  # Function call

    print("\nDivision Examples:")
    result = divide_numbers(10, 2)
    if result is not None:
        print("10 divided by 2 is:", result)
    divide_numbers(10, 0)  # This will raise an exception

    # List, Tuple, and Dictionary Examples
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
    my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

    print("Dictionary:", my_dict)

    # Membership and Identity Operators
    if 3 in my_list:  # Membership operator
        print("3 is in the list.")

    # Using 'is' operator
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = a
    if a is b:  # Identity operator
        print("a and b refer to the same object.")

# Entry point of the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # Calling the main function
```

### Breakdown of the Code

1. **Imports and Constants**:

   - `import math`: Imports the math module.
   - `PI = 3.14159`: A constant using ALL_CAPS.

2. **Function Definitions**:

   - `def area_of_circle(radius: float) -> float`: A function with type annotations and a docstring.
   - `def loop_examples()`: Demonstrates loops (for and while).
   - `def divide_numbers(num1: float, num2: float) -> float`: Handles exceptions during division.

3. **Main Function**:

   - Calls the area calculation, loop examples, and division examples.
   - Uses lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

4. **Control Flow**:

   - `if __name__ == "__main__":` is a common pattern in Python to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.

5. **Symbols and Operators**:

   - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`).
   - Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`).
   - Comparison (`in`, `is`).
   - Logical operations are used in the form of conditions.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Uses a `try` and `except` block to handle potential errors.

This example incorporates a wide variety of Python keywords, symbols, and common coding rules, making it a comprehensive demonstration of the language's syntax and structure. Let me know if you have any questions or need further details!
